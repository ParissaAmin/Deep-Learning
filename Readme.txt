The Summary of Model:

Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying fashion MNIST dataset into 10 categories.
Compiled and trained the CNN model using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, achieving a test accuracy of 90.94%.
Employed SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions and visualize the impact of features on predictions, utilizing different maskers and partition explainer methods.
Demonstrated visualization of SHAP values for correct and incorrect predictions, enhancing the interpretability of the CNN model.
